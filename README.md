#### Feature Tasks  

#### backend
* create an app on the google dev console
 * configure oauth credentials to support a client app on `http://localhost`

#### frontend 
* create an index.html with an anchor tag pointing to the google authorization page 
* configure the query string with correct key value pairs

#### Documentation  
Write a description of the project in your README.md, including detailed instructions for how to build your app. In your frontend README.md add a code block with your frontend .env vars, and in your backend README.md add a code block with your backend .env vars.
